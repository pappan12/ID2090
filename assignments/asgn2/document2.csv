id, document
1, this is a sample sentence.
2, there are 3 sentences in this sample.
3, this is a placeholder sentence.
4, this is just another sample sentence for testing purposes.
5, tfidf testing is important for natural language processing tasks.
6, each document in this dataset contains a unique identifier.
7, the purpose of this dataset is to test tfidf algorithms.
8, tfidf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency.
9, tfidf is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining.
10, tfidf helps in identifying the importance of words in a document.
11, tfidf assigns higher weights to words that are rare in the entire dataset but frequent in a particular document.
12, tfidf can be used for various NLP tasks such as document classification and clustering.
13, tfidf is a powerful tool for text analysis.
14, tfidf can handle large datasets efficiently.
15, tfidf algorithms require a collection of documents as input.
16, tfidf is based on the idea that words that occur frequently in a document but rarely in other documents are important.
17, tfidf is widely used in search engines for document ranking.
18, tfidf is an unsupervised learning algorithm.
19, tfidf is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document.
20, tfidf is calculated by multiplying the term frequency and inverse document frequency.
21, tfidf is useful for extracting keywords from a document.
22, tfidf can be customized by adjusting parameters such as smoothing and normalization.
23, tfidf values are typically normalized to prevent bias towards longer documents.
